# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi, I am Abhinav Tripathi. The thoughts expressed here are solely my own
  and not the views of my employer. I would mostly be talking here about 
  software development, distributed systems and machine learning (I might
  digress into other things occasionally though). I am a software developer
  always looking to hone and improve his skill (my current designation is 
  engineering manager though :).
